# hand-written-digits-recognition-using-ANN
a python program for hand written digits recognition<br>
This is the first project for Computational Inteligence course at Amirkabir university - Spring 2021<br>
Here we used python and numpy library to create a neural network with 2 hidden layer, and then we did the training with Backpropagtion method on the MNIST dataset.<br>
